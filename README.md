# ShapeArea

This is a python command line utility that can calculate the areas of three different shapes, namely, the cube, the ellipsoid, and the pyramid. 

### Prerequisites

Things you will need to start using the program 
 
```
Python3.6
```
_You can go to www.python.org for instructions on installing the python3.6 interpreter._
To check if you have python installed type into your command line
```
python
```
and something like the following should appear
```
Python 3.6.3 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct 15 2017, 03:27:45) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
 
### Using

The best way to use the program is through IDLE or something like PyCharm but it can also be run from the command line

Open your program of choice. Be it IDLE or simply using the <b>command line.</b>
Type the following into your command line
```
cd /The-Directory-where-the-file-is/ShapeArea
```

And then run the program with python, like so

```
python shapeArea.py
```
and then the program will prompt you to enter the names of the shapes whose areas you will be calculating.<br/>
Afterwards the command line will ask you for the side lengths of the shapes in order in arbitrary units.<br/>
This program will continue looping until you type 
```
quit
```
into the prompt.
